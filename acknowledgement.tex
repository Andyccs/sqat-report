I would like to express my appreciation to my professor. In particular, I am deeply indebted to Dr. Owen Noel Newton Fernando. He has provided me with invaluable support, encouragement, and advice throughout my time at Nanyang Technological University, and has worked tirelessly to guide me in my project. He has inspired me both as a person and as a teacher.

I gratefully acknowledge the support provided by Foo Chee yong, Soe Lynn, Hee Jun Yi and many others. I also thank Jiang Xiaoxuan for generously volunteering her time whenever I needed help. Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support and encouragement throughout this time.
