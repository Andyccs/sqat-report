\end{center}

Software quality is the degree to which software possesses a desired combination of attributes. We build Software Quality Analysis Tool to assess all codes submitted by Nanyang Technological University students for assignments and projects. To elicit possible user requirements, we examine a free and open source tool called SonarQube and a commercial tool called SciTool in details. To build the software quality measurement component, we use Goal Question Metric approach to calculate scores for software quality attributes and implement framework proposed by \cite{washizaki2007framework}. We also point out various challenges we face during the design and implementation phases, and the solutions to these challenges. Finally, to ensure the quality of SQAT project, we discuss about continuous testing, and the services we used, i.e. Travis CI and Coverall.
